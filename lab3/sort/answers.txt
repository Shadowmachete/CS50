sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: sort1 is faster than sort3 for already sorted data which is indicative of bubble sort's minimum time complexity Omega (n)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: sort2 runs much faster than sort1 and sort3 and has to be the fastest sorting algorithm of bubble, selection and merge sort which is merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 is slightly faster than sort1 for random and reversed tests but not for the already sorted data
