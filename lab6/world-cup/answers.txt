Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With only 10 simulations, the team 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

100000 simulations is good enough as it is the most simulations with less than 1 second and is most cost effective than 1000000 and is better than the lower simulation numbers
